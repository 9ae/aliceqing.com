			<p>Exploring expressive therapy through movement and music.</p>
			<p>
				The first project during my enrollment at <a href="https://www.ironhack.com" target="_blank">Ironhack</a> was to design an app around the theme of wellness. Therapy sessions can be expensive, how might we provide the benefits of expressive therapy in the comfort of your own space for free?</p>

			<h2 class="major">User Research</h2>
			<p>I surveyed 10 people and 3 people, who enjoys doing some form of art for leisure.
			And also learn about people's relationship with mental health.</p>

			<p>I also learned about the cycle of depression and anxiety some people struggle with. Research shown that painting in art therapy is an effective for people struggling with depression, because they are creating something with their bare hands.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="inner">
			<p>From interviews, I've learned from them that not all art heals, but when it is:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Non-competitive</li>
			<li>No social pressure (in private)</li>
			<li>In the moment (improvised)</li>
		</ul>

		<hr />

			<p>When asked "how does making art for leisure make them feel?" in the survey, the 3 most frequent answers are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Self-aware</li>
				<li>Relaxed</li>
				<li>Free</li>
			</ul>

			<p>'Body introspection', a phrase one interviewee used stucked in my mind. And another interviewee talked about the joy of dancing alone when they are home alone. I decided to explore the relationship between movement and music.</p>
			<p>What if you can improvise music by hand gestures alone? Instead of dancing to the music, <strong>you dance to make music</strong>.</p>

			<h2 class="major">How to Test the Idea</h2>
			<p>How can I prototype & test an interaction that relies on sound and motion in 2 days?</p>

			<h4>Challenges</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Lacked motion sensor chips and Arduino while living abroad</li>
				<li>The sounds made must sound good, no matter how the user moves</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<div class="inner">

			<p>But I realized that lacking hardware and generating music are not problems this stage. Firstly, I need to gage people's emotion response to the act of generating music by moving around.</p>
			<h4>Faking it</h4>
			<ol class="alt">
				<li>My Android phone had an accelerometer and gyroscope!</li>
				<li>Music generation can be faked. Download an obscure song, play it when the device is in motion, and pause it when it is still.</li>
			</ol>

			<li>Nonetheless some users expressed the remixing popular songs would be just as fun as making new songs.</li>
