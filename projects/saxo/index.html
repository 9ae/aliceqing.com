			<p>Exploring expressive therapy through movement and music.</p>
			<p>
				The first project during my enrollment at <a href="https://www.ironhack.com" target="_blank">Ironhack</a> was to design an app around the theme of wellness. Therapy sessions can be expensive, how might we provide the benefits of expressive therapy in the comfort of your own space for free?</p>

			<h2 class="major">User Research</h2>
			<p>I surveyed 10 people and 3 people, who enjoys doing some form of art for leisure.
			And also learn about people's relationship with mental health.</p>

			<p>I also learned about the cycle of depression and anxiety some people struggle with. Research shown that painting in art therapy is an effective for people struggling with depression, because they are creating something with their bare hands.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="inner">
			<p>From interviews, I've learned from them that not all art heals, but when it is:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Non-competitive</li>
			<li>No social pressure (in private)</li>
			<li>In the moment (improvised)</li>
		</ul>

		<hr />

			<p>When asked "how does making art for leisure make them feel?" in the survey, the 3 most frequent answers are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Self-aware</li>
				<li>Relaxed</li>
				<li>Free</li>
			</ul>

			<p>'Body introspection', a phrase one interviewee used stucked in my mind. And another interviewee talked about the joy of dancing alone when they are home alone. I decided to explore the relationship between movement and music.</p>
			<p>What if you can improvise music by hand gestures alone? Instead of dancing to the music, <strong>you dance to make music</strong>.</p>

			<h2 class="major">How to Test the Idea</h2>
			<p>How can I prototype & test an interaction that relies on sound and motion in 2 days?</p>

			<h4>Challenges</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Lacked motion sensor chips and Arduino while living abroad</li>
				<li>The sounds made must sound good, no matter how the user moves</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<div class="inner">

			<p>But I realized that lacking hardware and generating music are not problems this stage. Firstly, I need to gage people's emotion response to the act of generating music by moving around.</p>
			<h4>Faking it</h4>
			<ol class="alt">
				<li>My Android phone had an accelerometer and gyroscope!</li>
				<li>Music generation can be faked. Download an obscure song, play it when the device is in motion, and pause it when it is still.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Should this app be about creating/improvising music or conducting/remixing a song? </p>
		</div>
		<div class="inner">
			<blockquote>Improvising music ~ accomplishment & freedom <br />
				Remixing music ~ control & agency
			</blockquote>

			<p>Due to time constraints, my instructors advised me to focus on the remixing portion, which will be aimed to help people deal with anxiety. </p>

			<p>For that I had to do additional research about people who struggle with anxiety. Luckily, the persoan I created during the research phase copes with anxiety. So I built my findings around my persona. </p>

			<p>27 years old from Puerto Rico living in Toronto, ON pursuing a PhD in Experimental Physics</p>

			<!-- <p>During his past summer vacation back home, he rediscovered his love for playing the cello. Without the pressure of having to worry about orchestral competitions, he started to improvise whilst playing and finds a sense of freedom and calmness in making music.</p> -->

			<p class="caption">Toni as an irregular sleep and work schedule, which runs on 30 hour days. Often he is in the lab until 4-6AM. Finds himself either having too little sleep or sleeping too much due to working consecutively for 16-20 hours. <br />

			Toni difficulty adjusting to the colder climate, shorter days, and less sunlight becuase his lab is in the basement. <br />

			He's been stressed about his dissertation not going well.
			He's also worried about his family in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Irma. They still don’t have power. <br />

			Recently been having panic attacks. During his first one he mistaken it as a heart attack, went to the ER at his university’s hospital, because he is unfamiliar with psycho-somatic reactions. The doctors recommend he seeks counseling. <br />

			He does want to prevent future panic attacks, and find ways to manage his general anxiety and cope with depression.</p>
