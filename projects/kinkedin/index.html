			<h1 class="major">Journey of Kinkedin</h1>
			<p>Late 2016, I joined <a href="https://www.trykinkedin.com" target="_blank">KinkedIn</a> team as their technical co-founder, when Steve Dean, primier online-dating consultant, recommended me to their CEO because my knowledge on online dating apps (from to my <a href="/#jush" target="_blank">General Assembly project</a> and helping him perform competitive analysis for his own work).
I fill into whatever roles my two other co-founders need me to be. Over the course of this on-going project, I have been the user researcher, product designer, and developer.

			<p>De-stigmatize the marginalized</p>
			<p>One of my first task on the team was to redesign their logo. Their existing logo was about boundaries, when and how to say no. We want to move forward as a company striving for the "enthusiastic yes"! My teammates wanted a logo that conveyed: connectedness, wholeness, and embracing queerness. The logo I designed for us is inspired by the shibari knot of a heart. </p>

		<h3>How may we find potential matches for our users?</h3>
		<p>One problem our CEO identified in his competitive analysis of existing fetish dating apps (Whiplr, KNKI, Vanilla Umbrella) is that there is no way to find people who match with you in a reciprocal interest when it comes to fetishes that involve one giving and receiving. For example, two people may be both into bondage, but do they like to do the tying or being tied up? It’s no use if we match two people who enjoy being tied up.

		<h3>Eureka!</h3>
		<p>After drawing the problem out on my blackboard, I realized our problem can be abstracted into a <a  href="" target="_blank">graph theory</a> problem.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="inner uphigh">
		<h3>We can rephrase our problem as...</h3>
		<p>Users are potential matches for each other, if there exist a path of length-2, between them. <br />
			i.e: If we were to return matches for Gretchen: Jimmy would be a good candidate but not Edgar.</p>

	<p>Users are better potential matches for each other, if the number of length-2 paths between them are greater.</p>

<p>This realization, made the solution of finding matches for our users clear, since it’s already solvable using existing mathematics principles.</p>

		<h2 class="major">Other Considerations</h2>
		<p>At the end of the day, we are still building a dating app. And so much of a user's experience with the our brand is depends on things that happen outside the app. How do we address general dating app issues?</p>

		<p>Can encourage our users to treat each other with respect?</p>

		<p>How can we hold ourselves accountable for users' safety?</p>

			<h2 class="major">Problem Statement</h2>
			<h3>How may we encourage our users to treat each other with respect?</h3>
			<p>“Online dating sucks”, is a phrase you commonly hear from a New Yorker, regardless of gender or sexual orientation. When asked to ask why, the reason often refers to the way people treat each other in the dating scene.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="inner uphigh">

			<h4>Why do so many people sum their dating experience to be unpleasant?</h4>

			<p>Online dating opens doors, it shrinks the miles, bridges social divides. It brings people who may not have the chance to run into each other in their daily lives, into awareness of each other existence. However it also gives you the impression that your options are limitless. The better option may be just one swipe away. People become reduced to profiles.</p>

	<p>Coffee Meets Bagel started their business by selecting for you one profile to review a day.
	As a result, their users often treat each other with more respect than users on Tinder or OKCupid, which gives user almost an boundless sea of fish. I decided to borrow a page from their book, with some modifications. </p>

<h2 class="major">Feature Story</h2>
<h3>Daily Matches!</h3>
	<p>Like Tinder, when you and another user like eachother it's considered a match! But you can only have up to 7 matches a day. After that we will stop showing you profiles, and encourage you to chat with your matches. </p>
	<img src="/projects/kinkedin/matches_reached.jpg" class="image-fill90" />
</div>
<div class="inner uphigh">
	<h3>The reason behind this decision is...</h3>
<p>A phrase I commonly hear from one segment of the users is “Coffee Meets Bagel does not work!” Since women tend to be more selective of who they “like”, mutual matches are less common for lesbians and straight men.
Instead of giving you a set number of profiles to review daily, we will show you as many users who fits your preference criteria. Until you've reached 7 matches that day.</p>

		<h3>Aftercare Check-in</h3>
		<blockquote>Aftercare refers specifically to the time and attention given to a partnerat the end of a scene. It is the comfort one provides to other partipants after having an intense experience that can leave an individual, top or bottom, in a vulnerable state.</blockquote>

		<p>The safety of our users is our priority, we want to be able to check in with users to make sure they are not endangered by being on our platform.</p>
<p>From interviews, I’ve learned a tactic people employ when they go on a date that my be a little sketchy is that they tell their friends about the date, and their friends will check in on them afterwards. Because some forms of kink is still a highly stigmatized practice, people may not have come out or be ready to their friends.</p>

<p>Our Aftercare service lets you let us know that you are going to meet with someone on our platform and also with whom. We will check in with you 12 hours after your scheduled date.
Even if nothing went wrong, it's still fun to gush about a good date!</p>

		<h3 class="major">Lessons Learned</h3>
<p>For this aftercare feature, we put together a team of trauma trained therapist, who together with our Content Director crafted the language of how we would communicate with our users when we check in with them.I was responsible for the flow, making sure logically the conversation fit together. From the script they spent me, I constructed the flow chart that would guide how I am to program out chatbot.</p>
<p>But I also had to put myself in the mind of a user who might have just got out of a traumtizing date to predict how they would respond to our messages. Empathizing with a traumatized user, through the several iterations of constructing a conversation flow proved to be an emotionally and physically draining experience for me. I have a new found respect for our community accountability team, who has to do this on regular basis as social workers</p>

		<h3>Firstly, Fail Fast</h3>
		<p>Test the subset of features we focused on was setting up your profile, and viewing other users profiles and “liking” users.</p>
		<p>One of the design challenges we’ve been having is figuring out how to make selecting the long list of kinks and fetishes intuitive. Our initial implementation was very methodological, we it was almost a direct approach to how our graph database stores data. </p>

		<h3>This part of the flow in the profile setup felt overall awkward and cumbersome.</h3>

		<p>We realized the language directional provide/receive may not apply for all of them, making the sentence sound awkward.
Also with each kink you like it leads to to another screen describing the kink and asking you to select direction. The process of checking things you are interested in got tiring.</p>
<p>Most people stopped after selecting 5, even if there’s more they are interested in.</p>

<p>How one engages with their latex fetish, is very different from how they may engage with the desire for discipline.</p>
