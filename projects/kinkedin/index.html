			<h1 class="major">Journey of Kinkedin</h1>
			<p>Late 2016, I joined <a href="https://www.trykinkedin.com" target="_blank">KinkedIn</a> team as their technical co-founder, when Steve Dean, primier online-dating consultant, recommended me to their CEO because my knowledge on online dating apps (from to my <a href="/#jush" target="_blank">General Assembly project</a> and helping him perform competitive analysis for his own work).
I fill into whatever roles my two other co-founders need me to be. Over the course of this on-going project, I have been the user researcher, product designer, and developer.

			<p>Logo design & brand values</p>
			<p>One of my first task on the team was to redesign their logo. Their existing logo was about boundaries, when and how to say no. We want to move forward as a company striving for the "enthusiastic yes"! My teammates wanted a logo that conveyed: connectedness, wholeness, and embracing queerness. The logo I designed for us is inspired by the shibari knot of a heart. </p>
